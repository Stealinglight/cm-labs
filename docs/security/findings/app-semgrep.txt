================================================================================
                        SEMGREP ANALYSIS SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
Project: cm-labs (React Portfolio Site)

SCAN RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. React + TypeScript Rules (p/react, p/typescript)
   - Rules Run: 74
   - Files Scanned: 69
   - Findings: 0

2. Security Audit Rules (p/security-audit)
   - Rules Run: 22
   - Files Scanned: 72
   - Findings: 0

3. OWASP Top Ten Rules (p/owasp-top-ten)
   - Rules Run: 76
   - Files Scanned: 72
   - Findings: 0

TOTAL FINDINGS: 0

SECURITY ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This clean result is expected for a static React portfolio site because:

1. No User Input Processing
   - No forms that accept user input
   - No query parameter handling
   - No URL path-based dynamic content

2. No Backend Integration
   - No API calls that could be vulnerable to injection
   - No authentication/authorization code
   - No session management

3. No Dangerous React Patterns
   - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage found
   - No eval() or Function() calls
   - No dynamic script injection

4. Static Content Only
   - All content is hardcoded/imported at build time
   - No runtime content loading from external sources
   - No dynamic imports of untrusted code

REAL-WORLD IMPACT ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Risk Level: LOW

This portfolio site has minimal attack surface because:
- It's a purely presentational site with no user interaction
- Content is bundled at build time (no runtime data fetching)
- No sensitive data is processed or stored
- No authentication or authorization mechanisms exist

The main security considerations for this type of site are:
1. Supply chain security (covered by npm audit, osv-scanner)
2. CI/CD security (covered by actionlint, zizmor)
3. Secret exposure (covered by gitleaks, trufflehog)

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The codebase passes all semgrep security scans. This result aligns with the
project's architecture as a static React site with no backend, no user input,
and no authentication requirements.
